    <p style="color: black; padding: 10px;"> Mawimbi Tea Company is a subsidiary of Kenya Tea Development Agency Limited (KTDA), <br> 
      which is the largest small scale farmer umbrella body in the World with over 650,000 farmers. <br>
      These farmers own over 60 tea processing factories and produce slightly above 60% of all Kenyan tea. <br>
      We have remained at the forefront of embracing technology and refreshed our local and international <br>customers from insights and expertise gathered over 40 years since inception in 1978. <br>
      Our leaves are handpicked from lush green tea fields in Kenyaâ€™s pristine highlands, <br>
      7000 feet above sea level. Our tea is manufactured locally by Mawimbi factories <br>
      and Mawimbi members and we pick only the best for packaging. To complement our tea business,<br>
      we have Afya Purified drinking water which is packaged in our Mombasa factory through modern technology. <br>
      Our primary focus is to avail high quality Kenyan-grown tea and safe drinking water at affordable prices  <br>
      while having a positive impact in our communities and employees.Through our backward integration with KTDA,we are able to transform and empower hundreds of thousands of tea farmers in tea growing zones <br>
      in health, education, economic empowerment and environmental sustainability.
